                <th class="align-top">Capacity Alterations</th>
                <td class="align-middle">The most challenging aspect of the Woolen Mill dam is its limited capacity. Its total capacity is ~4,000 cfs. As required by NR 333 the Woolen Mill
                    dam would need to pass a 500 year flood, a flow volume of ~7,000 cfs, which requires increasing the dams total spillway capacity by ~3,000 cfs, an increase of ~75%. There are a few 
                    options to increase the capacity of the Woolen Mill dam outside of completely rebuilding it, a spillway gate could be installed in the dam's crest, or an auxillary spillway and gate
                    could be created in the old millrace area. In addition the height of the dam can be reduced, the dam can be lengthened, or a combination of these geometry changes can be used along with 
                    spillway re-profiling, which alone only 
                    yields modest gains. A combination of these strategies would likely need to be used to increase the Woolen Mill dam's
                    capacity because of the tight space of the site. Any of, or a combination of these strategies would significantly alter the dam, and/or threaten the original limestone wing wall with demolition. 
                    In addition alterations 
                    will likely be very expensive,
                    in 2007 Mead & Hunt estimated altering the spillway to meet the 100 year flood capacity required at the time would cost ~$900,000 without any land acquisition. Altering the dam to meet 
                    the now required 500 year flood volume will likely be more expensive.
