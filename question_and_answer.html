            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col"><p>A: Determining whether a dam itself is historic depends largely on its context. Mill dams are generic structures that provide power to the industry they serve, similar to electric power, 
                    steam power, gas power, etc and therefore mill dams generally won't be found on the NRHP, wheras their mills are. However, a dam that is original, has unique features, still has a mill, etc may have a case for historic status. 
                    It is also important to note that an undammed river may also be considered historic because of its importance to natives, and/or predammed flora and fauna. Applying this to the Woolen Mill dam, the Woolen Mill dam does not have a very strong 
                    historical context (see Dam history). Hydropower at the Woolen Mill fell out of favor in 1896 a mere 31 years after the original dam was built when steam power was installed with the Mills expansion.  
                    Furthermore, the current dam is not original to the mill, the original dam washed out in 1933, construction of the current dam began in 1938 and was completed in 1939, 
                    shortly before the decline of the Woolen Mill. The Woolen Mill declined in the post war years, went idle in the 1960s then shut down completely in 1968, just 29 years after the new dam was completed.
                    The existing dams' contribution to the Woolen Mill and Cedarburg's industrial past is very limited.  </p></div>

            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col"><p>A: This is unlikely, mill dams do not generate additional discharge, they impound water behind them and raise the level of the water. The interaction between ground and surface water
                will likely change in the area of the impoundment upon removal and this may increase or decrease the discharge through the former impoundment, although with little effect. The fact that a dam was built suggests that
                the discharge through the river was high enough to justify the construction of a mill and dam. If removed the amount of water moving through the former impoundment will likely be
                the same, however the channel geometry will change resulting in a narrower and faster moving stream.</p></div>

                <div class = "col"><p>A: Many mill dams, including the Woolen Mill dam, have impoundments that are full of silt, meaning there is little capacity for the storage of flood water.
                    Storage of flood water also requires gates, or other control infrastructure to manage the level of water behind the dam, the Woolen Mill dam does not have any water level controls. Also mill
                    dams with no water level controls raise the flood plain.

                <div class = "col"><p>A: The Woolen Mill impounment is small, modelling has indicated that upon dam removal the amount of surface water in the impoundment will be reduced by ~50%, 3 Hectares (7.5 Acres)
                    over its 1.3km (0.8 mile) length under median flow conditions. The amount of exposed land will be relatively small, and any dam removal will be accompanied by bank restoration which involves planting of the banks.
                    Newly exposed land will only be mud for a short period.

                <div class = "col"><p>A: It is difficult to predict in great detail what Cedar Creek will look like without the Woolen Mill dam, however most old mill dams are built on bedrock and the limestone outcrops
                    near the Woolen Mill dam suggest this is the case. There will likely be rapids or a natural waterfall under the current and original dams, upstream will likely be a sandy/gravelly bottom stream. Applying
                    a simple model created by the trends of upstream widths suggests the new channel will narrow as it moves downstream, with a median width of ~20m (65feet). The predicted values of this model are consistent with what is seen
                    in the small stretch of un impounded creek below the Woolen Mill dam.

                    removal and elimination of the need to portage. New recreation and tourist activities may also be created with an expanded creek walk, and improvement of the riverine environment both possible only with the removal of the Wollen Mill dam.
