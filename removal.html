        <p>In order to address the Woolen Mill dam's capacity and condition issues the simplest solution is to remove the existing dam and complete any necessary masonry repair on the limestone wingwall.
            Removal of the Woolen Mill dam is preferable to repair and alteration for a number of reasons.

                <td class="align-top">Removing the Woolen Mill dam will be far less expensive than replacing or repairing and altering the current one. 
                    This cost saving was demonstrated by the removal of the West Bend Woolen 
                    Mill dam in 1988, the cost to replace the dam was $3.3 million,
                    compared to $86,000 to remove the dam and $200,000 to build a park.
                    In addition removal also eliminates all future costs of owning and operating the dam, 
                    including inspections, maintenance, and insurance costs.
                    The Woolen Mill dam is currently mostly owned by the City of Cedarburg, removing the dam eliminates all future costs for the City of Cedarburg.
                    This translates into saved tax dollars at the local level. It also eliminates costs of the Wisconsin DNR, that translates to saved tax dollars
                    at the state level.

                <td class="align-top">Dams have detrimental effects on water quality by creating an impoundment behind them.
                    This changes the river geometry resulting in slower water movement through the impoundment. This causes accumulation of 
                    organic matter, and the river water to warm in the impoundment. This results in warm low oxygen water, unfavorable for many species. 
                    It also allows the river to
                    drop its sediment load, this alters the streambed which impacts habitat for benthic organisms, as well as fills the impoundment with sediment further
                    changing the river geometry and exacerbating water quality issues.
                    Removing the Woolen Mill dam will improve the water quality in Cedar Creek in the area of the dams former
                    impoundment.

                <td class="align-top">Dams fragment habitats by presenting a barrier that blocks or restricts movement of aquatic organisms. 
                    As mentioned above they also alter streambeds and degrade water
                    quality which impact aquatic organisms. Removing the Woolen Mill dam will restore a mile of Cedar Creek, increasing the amount
                    of quality riverine habitat.

                    however the limestone wing wall arguably 
                    is since it is original to the mill. Its presence is threatened by alteration and repair of the dam. 
                    By removing the dam, the original limestone wing wall's preservation will be ensured.
