            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col"><p>A:  Determining whether a dam itself is historic depends largely on its historical context. Mill dams are common structures that provide power to the industry they serve, similar to contemporary
                    energy sources like electricity and natural gas. The mill itself is where the products were made and history occurred, Cedar Creek at one point had five mills that produced a variety of products from hydropower including textiles, grain products,
                    and drawn steel products. A mill dam may be considered historic if it has a strong historical context, e.g. originality, unique design and features, and a long industrial history. 
                    It is also important to note that an undammed river may also be considered historic because of its importance to people before it was dammed and its importance to native species. Taking this into consideration the Woolen Mill dam does not have a very strong 
                    historical context (see Dam history). Hydropower at the Woolen Mill fell out of favor in 1896 only 31 years after the original dam was built when steam power was installed with the mills expansion.  
                    Furthermore, the current dam is not original to the mill, the original dam washed out in 1933, construction of the current concrete gravity dam began in 1938 and was completed in 1939, 
                    shortly before the end of the Woolen Mill. The Woolen Mill declined in the post war years, went idle in the 1960s, then shut down completely in 1968, just 29 years after the new dam was completed.
                    Considering the existing dams' short industrial life, and lack of outstanding features and design make it a very poor candidate for historic preservation. </p></div>

            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col"><p>A: No, mill dams themselves do not generate additional discharge, they impound water behind them and raise the level of the water. Furthermore the Woolen Mill dam does not have any control
                structures that affect flow patterns. There may be minor changes to discharge due to a change in interaction with the local groundwater upon removal, but the effect on discharge will likely be minimal.

            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col"><p>A: Many mill dams, including the Woolen Mill dam, have impoundments that are full of silt, meaning there is little capacity for the storage of flood water.
                    Storage of flood water also requires gates, or other control infrastructure to manage the level of water behind the dam, the Woolen Mill dam does not have any water level controls.

                    will be accompanied by bank restoration in which the newly exposed banks will be replanted.

                <div class = "col"><p>A: It is difficult to predict in great detail what Cedar Creek will look like without the Woolen Mill dam, however most old mill dams are built on bedrock and the bedrock outcrops
                    near the Woolen Mill dam suggest this may be the case. There will likely be exposed bedrock creating rapids or a natural waterfall under the current and original dams, upstream will likely be a sandy/gravelly bottom stream similar to what Cedar
                    Creek looks like upstream of the impoundment. Applying
                    a simple model created by the trends of upstream widths suggests the new channel will narrow as it moves downstream, with a median width of ~20m (65feet) through the old impoundment. The predicted values of this model are consistent with what is seen
                    in the small stretch of un impounded creek below the Woolen Mill dam suggesting an amount of validity. In addition flow velocities will greatly increase with the removal of the dam.

                    removal. New recreation and tourist activities may also be created with an expanded creek walk, and improvement of the riverine environment both possible only with the removal of the Woolen Mill dam.
